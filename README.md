2014RobotJava
=============
This code for the 2014 competition season robot rewritten in Java, which was originally written in C++.
Each robot subsystem has a corresponding class. There are also two utitlity classes that are new, 
the FileReader, which reads data into a Vector from a text file, and GyroDrive, which handles the PID 
control of the robot's rotation using a gyro to prevent unwanted rotation when strafing with 
the mecanum wheel chassis.
